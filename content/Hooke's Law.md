**Hooke's Law** says that the change in length of an object is proportional to the applied force:
$$
F=k\Delta l
$$
If the force is too great, the object will exceed its Elastic Limit, meaning that it cannot return to its original shape. When the Ultimate Strength of the material is exceeded, the object will fracture.
