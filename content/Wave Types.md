#### Waves can be categorized by the medium used:

Mechanical Waves:
- Propagation takes place through a medium
- Properties of wave depend on material

Non-mechanical Waves:
- Takes place in a non-material media, i.e. in a vacuum
- I.E. Electromagnetic waves



#### Waves can be categorized by size of medium:

One dimensional/Linear
- Ex: oscillation on a 
Two dimensional
- Circular waves on a water surface
Three dimensional
- Sound waves


#### Waves can be categorized by the direction of oscillation:

Longitudinal waves:
- Oscillation parallel to wave motion

Transverse waves:
- Oscillation perpendicular to wave motion

Mixed waves:
- Oscillation in all directions.
