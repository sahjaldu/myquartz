# Hi There!

Welcome to PhysicsWeb, a place where I will be storing my physics notes for the public to use. This website was created using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), which was made by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/). Shoutout to Atramentis and Jacky who helped me set up this site.

This website is primarily navigated through links connecting pages together. There is also a graph view in this page for an alternative view. This website is incomplete, so make sure to visit in the future (and reload) for more.

## Topics:

[[Systems of Particles]]
[[Rotational Motion]]
[[Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture]]
[[Work, Power, and Energy]]
[[Fluids]]

## About Me:

My name is Sahat Jaldu, currently a high school senior. I made this website as part of my Independent Study and Mentorship class, where students choose a topic, study it, and make an impactful project with a professional in the field guiding them.

Physics is a topic that I am curious about, and I hope this website make you curious about it too :)
